# 3n-1-problem calculator

Start with any positive integer n.
Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows:
if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term.
If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.
The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1. 

This is a calculator that calculates the conjecture for any n you give.
